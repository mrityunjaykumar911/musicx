Music is probably the fastest way to connect to emotions. Emotional intelligence has a positive correlation with cognitive abilities, social functioning, mental and physical well-being as well as improvement of personal abilities. In one of Maria Iturriaga’s TEDx talks, she emphasizes that “It is impossible to feel anything with music”. 
The correct set of music can make people resistant to frustration and help them to make informed decisions in their chores. We propose an approach which mines the emotional background of people's music preferences and generates music by emotions as input instead.

# Problem :

Formulate a method to visualize the person’s preferential data and give music suggestions to a device or a user, based on the user’s mood/emotions and current activities.
